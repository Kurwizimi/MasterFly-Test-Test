In the 3rd century AD, the throne of Armenian Kings would fall to the occupation of the Sassanid Persians, successors of Parthia, but, with the aid of the Roman Emperor Aurelian, it would be restored unto you, Armenia's rightful King. As her King, you would first throw Gregory the Illuminator into prison for 14 years, yet he would escape with your sister's help and convert you to Christianity, leading you to proclaim Armenia's devotion as the first Christian state in the world, several dozen years prior the proclamation of Constantine the Great.",
